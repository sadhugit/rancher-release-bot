To generate your SLACK_BOT_TOKEN and SLACK_SIGNING_SECRET, you need to create an app within your Slack workspace using the Slack API website and configure its permissions. 
Step 1: Create a Slack App
Navigate to the Slack API: Your Apps page and sign in to your workspace.
Click Create New App and select the From scratch option.
Enter an App Name and select your development Workspace from the dropdown menu. Click Create App. 

Step 2: Retrieve the Signing Secret (SLACK_SIGNING_SECRET) 
From your app's basic information page, navigate to Settings > Basic Information in the left sidebar.
Scroll down to the App Credentials section.
You will find the Signing Secret listed here. Copy and save this value securely; it is your SLACK_SIGNING_SECRET. 

Step 3: Configure Bot Scopes and Install the App 
In the left sidebar, under Features, click OAuth & Permissions.
Scroll down to the Scopes section. Under Bot Token Scopes, click Add an OAuth Scope.
Add the necessary permissions for your app (e.g., chat:write, app_mentions:read). The specific scopes needed will depend on your bot's functionality.
Scroll to the top of the OAuth & Permissions page and click Install App to Workspace.
Review the permissions requested and click Allow to authorize the installation. 

Step 4: Retrieve the Bot Token (SLACK_BOT_TOKEN) 
After installation, you will be redirected back to the OAuth & Permissions page.
In the OAuth Tokens for Your Workspace section, you will see a Bot User OAuth Token (it starts with xoxb-).
Copy and save this value securely; it is your SLACK_BOT_TOKEN. Never commit this token to version control. 
You now have both the SLACK_BOT_TOKEN and SLACK_SIGNING_SECRET required to configure your Slack bot application. You can set them as environment variables in your project.
